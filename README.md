Dynamics-Simulator
==================

Simulates the various forces acting on a 2D convex polygons, resulting into the motion of the polygons.

Forces include :
- Gravitation
- Friction 
- Thrust
- Collision along boundary


Limitations:
- Deals with only 3 terms of Physics
- Floating point calculations


Enhancements that can be done:
- Sound effects for various events 
- Demonstration of Elastic and Inelastic collisions
- Fill color, Trace path
- Simulation of 3D bodies
